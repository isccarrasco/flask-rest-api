# flask-rest-api
REST API Developed using Flask, Blueprint, RESTPlus and Swagger for documenting the API.

This project is an example developed to show how to implement a REST API using Flask and RESTPlus and how can we documenting the API using Swagger documenting our code directly.

I took as an example [a post of Michal Karzynski blog](http://michal.karzynski.pl/blog/2016/06/19/building-beautiful-restful-apis-using-flask-swagger-ui-flask-restplus/).
